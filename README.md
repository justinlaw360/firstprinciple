# First Principle in Cyber Security

In the past 20 years, I have worked in the information security industry. In this 20 years, numerous theories, approaches, and solutions have been developed, all aimed at addressing problems in cybersecurity. However, a question often arises in my mind: Can these theories or principles truly address all security issues?

# First Principle
First principles refer to the fundamental concepts or assumptions upon which a theory, system, or understanding is based. It is a foundational approach to reasoning and problem-solving, where complex ideas are broken down into their most basic elements.

Elon Musk is known for his application of first principles thinking in various areas of his work. One notable example is his approach to the cost and efficiency of space travel, which led to the founding of SpaceX.  When Musk first looked at the cost of launching payloads into space, he realized that it was exorbitantly expensive due to the reliance on traditional aerospace manufacturing and launch practices. Rather than accepting these costs as fixed, he decided to question the underlying assumptions and break down the problem into its fundamental elements.

Musk identified two key cost drivers in the aerospace industry: the high prices of rocket components and the expendable nature of rockets. Instead of accepting the prevailing industry practice of building new rockets for each launch and discarding them after use, Musk applied first principles thinking to find a more cost-effective solution.  He started by examining the cost of materials and components, realizing that most of them were relatively inexpensive. By manufacturing key rocket components, such as the engines, in-house and seeking more affordable materials, he was able to significantly reduce costs compared to traditional suppliers.

However, the biggest breakthrough came when Musk challenged the assumption that rockets had to be expendable. Instead of accepting that rockets should be discarded after each launch, he set out to develop a reusable rocket system. This involved designing rockets that could land vertically after delivering their payloads to orbit, allowing them to be refurbished and flown again.

By applying first principles thinking to the problems of cost and reusability, Elon Musk and SpaceX were able to revolutionize the space industry. Today, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets are routinely reused, resulting in significant cost savings and making space travel more accessible.  This example showcases how Musk's ability to question assumptions and break down complex problems into their fundamental components allowed him to challenge the status quo and develop innovative solutions.

# Cyber Security
Then, what is the first principle or the most basic elements in Cyber security?  Before finding a definition of cyber security, it is important to figure out the **core problem** that we need to solve in cybersecurity.  Practitioners in information security are constantly working to address emerging threats and challenges.  But the fundumental problem should seldom change.

In Rick Howards Cybersecurity First Principles, Rick lays out a notional roadmap for cybersecurity’s first principle, which can be seen at the foundation of the image below.

This means that cybersecurity’s first principle is to “Reduce the Probability of **Material Impact**”.
