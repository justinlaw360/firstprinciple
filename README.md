# First Principle in Cyber Security

In the past 20 years, I work in the information security industry, now and then, numerous theories (e.g. Zero Trust, MITTRE, etc...), approaches (e.g. Holistic Approach, Risk-based Approach, etc...) , and solutions (e.g. UTM, WAF, SASE, CNAPP, EDR/XDR, etc...) have been developed, all aimed at addressing problems in cybersecurity. However, a question often arises in my mind: Can these theories or principles truly address all security issues?

# First Principle
First principles refer to the fundamental concepts or assumptions upon which a theory, system, or understanding is based. It is a foundational approach to reasoning and problem-solving, where complex ideas are broken down into their most basic elements.

Elon Musk is known for his application of first principles thinking in various areas of his work. One notable example is his approach to the cost and efficiency of space travel, which led to the founding of SpaceX.  When Musk first looked at the cost of launching payloads into space, he realized that it was exorbitantly expensive due to the reliance on traditional aerospace manufacturing and launch practices. Rather than accepting these costs as fixed, he decided to question the underlying assumptions and break down the problem into its fundamental elements.

Musk identified two key cost drivers in the aerospace industry: the high prices of rocket components and the expendable nature of rockets. Instead of accepting the prevailing industry practice of building new rockets for each launch and discarding them after use, Musk applied first principles thinking to find a more cost-effective solution.  He started by examining the cost of materials and components, realizing that most of them were relatively inexpensive. By manufacturing key rocket components, such as the engines, in-house and seeking more affordable materials, he was able to significantly reduce costs compared to traditional suppliers.

However, the biggest breakthrough came when Musk challenged the assumption that rockets had to be expendable. Instead of accepting that rockets should be discarded after each launch, he set out to develop a reusable rocket system. This involved designing rockets that could land vertically after delivering their payloads to orbit, allowing them to be refurbished and flown again.

By applying first principles thinking to the problems of cost and reusability, Elon Musk and SpaceX were able to revolutionize the space industry. Today, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets are routinely reused, resulting in significant cost savings and making space travel more accessible.  This example showcases how Musk's ability to question assumptions and break down complex problems into their fundamental components allowed him to challenge the status quo and develop innovative solutions.

# Cyber Security
Then, what is the first principle or the most basic elements in Cyber security?  Before finding a definition of cyber security, it is important to figure out the **core problem** that we need to solve in cybersecurity.  Practitioners in information security are constantly working to address emerging threats and challenges.  But the fundumental problem should seldom change.

In Rick Howards Cybersecurity First Principles, Rick lays out a notional roadmap for cybersecurity’s first principle, which can be seen at the foundation of the image below.

This means that cybersecurity’s first principle is to “Reduce the Probability of **Material Impact**”.

# Cyber Security Incidents Analysis

Let's zoom in what is the material impact.  I sort out the most citrical security incidents in each month of 2023 as table below.  Most belong to the impact of data leakage due to exfiltration by hackers.

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1. Domain Separation     |Refers to separating domains or areas of responsibility and control to enforce rules and protect data or resources.                            |- Computer processors running in supervisor and user domains. - Virtual machines or containers as separate domains.                                         |
|2. Process Isolation     |Involves isolating processes (programs) from each other to prevent interference or tampering. Each process has its own memory space and state. |- Word processor, database, and browser running in separate memory spaces. - Prosecution and defense attorneys running their cases separately in court.     |
|3. Resource Encapsulation|Resources, such as memory or disk drives, are encapsulated to control access and manipulation according to intended design.                    |- Website application logic encapsulating database access. - Text messaging and email programs on phones with limited data access.                          |
|4. Least Privilege       |Users and programs should only have the minimum privileges necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of misuse or accidental actions.|- Limiting administrative privileges on a computer to prevent malware attacks. - Revoking an employee's email account after leaving a company.              |
|5. Layering              |Employing multiple layers of protection that an attacker must overcome, increasing the difficulty of breaching a system.                       |- Moat, walls, and guards protecting a castle. - Firewall, intrusion detection systems, and access controls as layers of enterprise data protection.        |
|6. Abstraction           |Representing complex systems or concepts in a simplified manner, reducing complexity and potential distractions.                               |- Gauges in a car representing the car's performance. - A map as an abstraction of an area.                                                                 |
|7. Data Hiding           |Allowing only necessary aspects of data structures or records to be observed or accessed, preventing unauthorized changes or misuse.           |- Restricting access to certain data fields based on user roles. - Logging access attempts to monitor data manipulation.                                    |
|8. Modularization        |Breaking down complex systems or tasks into smaller, manageable modules for easier development and maintenance.                                |- Dividing a software application into separate modules with specific functions. - Breaking down a construction project into different phases or components.|
|9. Simplification        |Striving for simplicity in design and implementation to reduce complexity and potential vulnerabilities.                                       |- Removing unnecessary features or functionalities from a software product. - Streamlining administrative processes to minimize potential errors.           |
|10. Minimization         |Minimizing the attack surface by reducing the amount of code, features, or privileges, thereby reducing potential vulnerabilities and risks.   |- Removing unused or unnecessary code from a software application. - Limiting network services and protocols to essential ones only.                        |


# Cyber Security Team
In order to implement proper security controls and measures, a team of security professional persons must be hired.  Different skillset, knowledage and experience are grouped into teams. 

![IS Team](https://github.com/justinlaw360/firstprinciple/assets/4946026/e1690335-44bc-4fd7-9e22-321ff50c5659)

# In Summary
Cybersecurity is to reduce the possibility from material impacts, that caused by data disclosure, data tampering and data unavaibile.  And Cybersecurity framework, such as CIS, NIST, ISO27000, provide guidance to organsiation to manage cybersecurity.  The essential security measures should be implemented in every organization to prevent data exfiltration.  Last but in least, a team of well trained security professional (e.g. CISSP, CISA) could make the things happen effectively.
